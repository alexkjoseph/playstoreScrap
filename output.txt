         Positive: Well
         Negative: Its was very great! I love it. But the problem is, i can't duplicate the splitted clip to a layer like kinemaster. I am not a premium user, but worth to use it.👍👍 And please add unlimited layer.
         Positive: Good
         Negative: Have already contacted your support for this, as have many other people reviewing...So, on going to change my payment details, I've found everyone else has had same issues since your update. I've spent two days trying to edit a video, It doesn't hold edits made. Just goes back to original in production. Doesn't hold frame when trying to lock into the frame to splice. Dumps right back to the beginning of the project. Dam angry when 60 minutes in. Audio is glitching and getting out of sync. Again and again. So. Bye, I'm searching for better product.
